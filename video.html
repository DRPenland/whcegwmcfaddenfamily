       <h3>MCFADDENS AT BUFFALO FORGE</h3>
        <br/>
       <p>I, recently, discovered that Edward McFadden worked at Buffalo Forge as an agriculture overseer.  Edward McFadden is William Henry Clay McFadden's father.
         Buffalo Forge was owned by William Weaver, the wealthiest man of Rockbridge County, VA in the early 1800s.  I made the discovery by reading Charles Dew's book, 
         Bond of Iron: Master and Slave at Buffalo Forge.   William Weaver sold his forged iron to markets in Richmond and Lynchburg, VA.
         He used the James River and Kanawha Canal to ship his product to market.  Edward McFadden, previously, worked as a lock-keeper on the James River and Kanawha
         Canal in Nelson County, VA according to the 1850 census. William Henry Clay McFadden worked on the canal with his brother-in-law at Natural Bridge, VA in the 1870
         census. William Henry Clay is, also, mentioned briefly, in Charles Dew's book.  One wonders if Edward McFadden met William Weaver through the James River and Kanawha Canal. This book gives the reader a feel for what it was like to live in Rockbridge County, VA
        in the pre-Civil War era. It provides insight into the role that my ancestors played in history.
